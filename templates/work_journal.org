** Fixed Pip.
Turns out it was a package manager fight. Once I unemerged pip and
reinstalled it using the manual installer, it worked just fine.
*** Had issues installing different pips. Fixed it.
** Installed and played with Camxes.
It's a really easy tool.
** Kunal got back to me
*** TODO Look into IRSLTM
This is a modeling toolkit by Marcello Federico at FBK and University of Trento in Italy
*** TODO Look into Berkley POS (Parts of Speech) Tagger
*** TODO Look into Tree Tagger
*** TODO Look into shef.mt.tools Java package
*** TODO Go through MT work done by RWTH Aachen
Good enough for a jumping point in learning MT

** Emailed Riley, asked him for more resources
He saw it. What next...
** Adventures in Github

Parsers are more useful.\\
Does a Lojban to English translator exist?"
#+END_QUOTE

*** TODO Check out NLTK. See if it's good for Lojban (or too English-centric)
*** TODO Meet with him at 9:30, <2015-09-25 Fri>, preparing the above as demonstration
** Libraries are good places not to get distracted
